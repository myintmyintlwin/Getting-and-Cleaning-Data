Code Book
The run_analysis.R script includes the two parts, File reading and data cleaning.
PART I
1. Read the dataset and check the file list
•	Read the data files which are under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset
2. Read the data files and assign the data to their specified variables
	features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
	activity_Labels <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
	xtrain <- train/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns 
	xtest <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns 
	ytrain <- train/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
	ytest<- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
	subject_train <- train/subject_train.txt :7352 rows, 1 column
	subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows  1 column


PART II
There are five steps for data cleaning.
1. Merge the training and test data files respectively and then merge them into one
	create XYSub_train(7352 rows, 563 column) by merging the xtrain, ytrain and subject_train using cbind
	create XYSub_test (2947 rows, 563 columns) by merging the xtest, ytest and subject_test using cbind
	create the All_Data(10299 rows,  563 columns) by merging the XYSub_training and XYSub_test  using rbind
2.  Extracts the mean and standard deviation for measurements

	Create TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) by subsetting All_Data using select function such as subject, code to extract the mean and standard deviation

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
	Entire numbers in code column of the TidyData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

4. Setting labels the data set with descriptive variable names 
	All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
	All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
	All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
	All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
	All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
	All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
	FinalData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after grouped by subject and activity.
	Export Week4_Result.txt.
