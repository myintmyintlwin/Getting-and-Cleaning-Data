1.	CodeBook.md is a code book that describes the code explanations about variables and data transformation steps into final output.
2.	run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition:
    –	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    –	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    –	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    –	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    –	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3.	Week4_Result.txt is the exported data file after processing the above steps.
